# Gentoo dwm Rice Dotfiles - Winter24 & Spring24 Setups

This repository showcases my Gentoo dwm rice for "Winter24" and "Spring24". I run a very minimalistic setup with some theme customizations in Neovim and Alacritty to complement the aesthetics.

## About the Setups

### Winter24
System made to compliment the  "fcpg /vim-farout" theme
